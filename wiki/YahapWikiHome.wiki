= Introduction =

A project attempting to control web cams and x-10 devices through a web gui.

= Why Yet Another Home Automation Project? =
I've failed to find a project that fulfils the following requirements.
 * Is open source
 * Is written in Java
 * Is simple to use (homeseer like)
 * Uses current Java technologies:
  * JSF for web pages
  * Web services for exposing functionality
  * Maven for builds
  * Hibernate for database access, etc etc
 * and this is rather specific but I want it to work with my media center too!! so i need a media center plugin

= About the architecture =
To begin with the app is split into 3 projects:
 a) yahap-services: Controls devices and receives events from X-10 devices. The API is exposed as web services
 b) yahap-webapp: written in MyFaces/Tobago, it utilizes the exposed web services. This could be located on the same or a separate machine.
