#This project is not working yet.

= Introduction =

A project attempting to control web cams and x-10 devices through a web gui.

= Why another Home Automation Project? =
I've failed to find a project that fulfils the following requirements.
 * Is open source
 * Is written in Java
 * Is simple to use (homeseer like)
 * Uses current Java technologies:
  * JSF (or spring mvc) for web pages
  * Web services for exposing functionality
  * Maven for builds
  * Hibernate for database access, etc etc
 * and this is rather specific but I want it to work with my media center too!! so i need a media center plugin
