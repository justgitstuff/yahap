#summary A list of features and their prioritites

= Iterations and Stories =

Current Iteration is *0*, yes baby steps first

The purpose of this page is to put together a big wish list and assign priorites. Then get focus by concentrating on one iteration at a time. As I think up stuff I place it in the feature bucket. As an iteration ends I move stories from the bucket into the next iteration
