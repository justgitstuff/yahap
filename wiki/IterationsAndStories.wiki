#summary A list of features and their prioritites

= Iterations and Stories =

Current Iteration is *0*, yes baby steps first

The purpose of this page is to put together a big wish list and assign priorites. Then get focus by concentrating on one iteration at a time. As I think up stuff I place it in the feature bucket. As an iteration ends I move stories from the bucket into the next iteration

= Iterations =
== Iteration 0 ==
Story1: setup the project environment
  * Set up maven and project layout
  * Headings, paragraphs, and lists
  * Automatic links to other wiki pages

== Iteration 1 ==
